Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition,subtraction,multiplication,division.The aim is to improve students perfomance in calculation and may also save time duration for calculation,increase accuracy,improve efficiency and simplify complex calculations.  
Methodology of simple calculator:
A simple calculator functions by placing the input, number, into a calculator and then selecting an operation in which it must compute, resulting in the output.  
Key activities:  
Define arithmetic functions:define four functions for basic arithmetic operations.   
User input:prompt the user to enter two numbers and operation to perform.   
Call appropriate function:used a conditional statements to call function based on user input.    
Result:displays the result operation of the user.   
Handle errors:raise a valueError if the user attempts to divide by zero or enters invalid operation.   
technology used:   
Python:The programming language used to write the code and basic python programming concepts and syntax to create a program.
